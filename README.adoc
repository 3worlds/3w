3Worlds is a software for simulating the dynamics of ecosystems or, more generally, of any system that can be represented by a __dynamic graph__. More details on its purpose, motivation, design and technical details can be found in the documentation via the link below. 

3worlds aims at making modelling easier for people working in ecology and environmental science, by: 1) focusing on system representation (the ecosystem) rather than simulation techniques (e.g. discrete event, multi-agent etc.) all of which can be accomplished within 3Worlds and, 2) facilitating model comparison to establish an appropriate level of abstraction for the studied system by grounding all models upon the same concept of the ecosystem.

3Worlds uses state-of-the-art computing algorithms and allows end-users to focus on their problem rather than on obscure coding issues like how to find nearest neighbours or to synchronize processes running at different speeds. If you are a student or an academic in ecology or environmental sciences, then you may find it useful to quickly answer scientific questions.

3Worlds is written in Java and can run on Mac, Linux or Windows computers. It comprises two main applications:

* __ModelMaker__, to configure a model;

* __ModelRunner__, to run the model.

Creating a model involves creating a configuration with _ModelMaker_ and developing some associated Java code to specify details particular to your model. To do this, you must use the https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[Eclipse] programming software (freeware). Later versions of 3Worlds may support other programming software, but at the time of writing, 3Worlds will only work with Eclipse.

_ModelMaker_ will generate Java code for data structures specific to a model (based on the configuration file you have developed) and template java code for each process you have defined. These process templates are where you enter programming code to implement your model. You only need to write code for your processes and for model initialisation. All else is managed by 3Worlds.

== Downloads

=== Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your computer before installing 3Worlds:

* *Java JDK* (**J**ava **D**evelopment **K**it), version 11 or greater (https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html[Oracle] or http://openjdk.java.net/[open] version)
** to check if *java* is installed on your computer, open a terminal and type `java -version` on the command-line. If java is installed, it should return the version, e.g. `openjdk version "11.0.14" 2022-01-18`.
** to install java: 
*** linux users: open a terminal and type `sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk`
*** windows and MacOS users: install from the websites above

* *Java fx* (graphical user interface library for java: https://openjfx.io/[open] version)
** to check if *java-fx* is installed on your computer:
*** linux users: open a terminal and type `sudo apt-get install openjfx`. This should return a message saying this is already installed, or propose you to install it.
*** MacOS and windows users:  search in the installed application panel if you find the *java-fx* icon + name.
** to install *java-fx* on your computer:
*** linux users: open a terminal and type `sudo apt-get install openjfx`.
*** windows and MacOS users: 
. download the archive from the above web site, following the `download` link and specifying your OS in the list dropbox in the middle of the page; select the `JDK` version.
.  then, follow the installation instructions matching your operating system https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/#install-javafx[here]. Normally, only the first step (setting the environment variable) is required to run 3Worlds.

* an https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[**Eclipse**] Java development environment. **NOTE**: this is only required if you want to develop new models in 3worlds. To use the library of already installed models, tutorials and test models, you can skip this step.
* The statistics package https://www.r-project.org/[**R**] is required to run and analyse experiments.

=== Binaries

3worlds applications rely on the *Java fx* graphical user interface library, which differs between operating systems. For this reason, we provide three different downloads according to your operating system. They can be found under the https://github.com/3worlds/3w/releases/tag/1.0.2[latest release] link above.

The binary (jar) files are named `tw-linux.jar`, `tw-mac.jar` and `tw-win.jar` (hereafter generically referred to as `tw-<os>.jar`).

When using this software, please refer to it by quoting:

- Gignoux J., I.D. Davies, & S.R. Flint (2022). 3Worlds, a simulation platform for ecosystem modelling. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2022.110121[_Ecological Modelling_, 473:110121] for software design and general features;
- Gignoux J., I.D. Davies, & S.R. Flint (2022). 3worlds: a software for ecosystem simulation, version 1.0.3, https://zenodo.org/record/7038145[DOI:10.5281/zenodo.7038144] for the software itself.

== Running 3worlds

Once you have downloaded `tw-<os>.jar` according to your os:

. Create a directory named `3w` in your user account root directory
. Copy or move `tw-<os>.jar` to the `3w` directory
. __For linux users__: set the executable file permission of `tw-<os>.jar` to true (`chmod +x tw-<os>.jar` in a terminal, in the directory where the file is) so that it can be executed.
. Double-click on `tw-<os>.jar`. This should launch the _ModelMaker_ application.
. If this doesn't work, open a terminal and type `java -jar tw-<os>.jar`. This should launch the _ModelMaker_ application. However, to see log messages generated during execution, it is better to run `tw-<os>.jar` from a terminal.

WARNING: the launch will be successful only if the `3w` directory is in the user directory root and if `tw-<os>.jar` is in the `3w` directory.

== Libraries
Currently, the 3Worlds project has produced the following libraries, which are available separately as sub-projects:

https://github.com/3worlds/omhtk[omhtk]:: *omhtk* stands for _One More Handy Tool Kit_ and is a library of generic, very low-level interfaces (e.g. `Sizeable` for a class which instances have a size, `Resettable` for classes which can be 'reset', etc...) plus very commonly used utilities people keep rewriting all the time (e.g. an euclidian distance function or a time conversion method). Almost all other 3Worlds libraries depend on this one.
// yatk - yet another tool kit - should it be twcommons?

https://github.com/3worlds/omugi[omugi]:: *omugi* stands for _One More Graph Implementation_. It implements classes to represent dynamic graphs.
// why not omgi ? anyway, new c compliers are usually cally yacc - yet another c compiler.

https://github.com/3worlds/uit[uit]:: *uit* stands for _Universal Indexing Tree_. It implements classes to to provide efficient searching of spatial data. The base class is an `IndexingTree`. It is a generalisation of a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree[QuadTree], more accurately called a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree[_k_-d tree]. It is based on work by *Paavo Toivanen* found https://dev.solita.fi/2015/08/06/quad-tree.html[here].

https://github.com/3worlds/rvgrid[rvgrid]:: *rvgrid* stands for _Rendezvous Grid_. It contains a very basic implementation of https://www.adaic.org/[ADA]'s famous rendezvous system used to exchange data between parallel tasks and an implementation of a universal discrete state machine designed by *Shayne Flint*.

https://github.com/3worlds/aot[aot]:: *aot* stands for _Aspect-Oriented Thinking_. It groups class for building and testing specification to build software or other human-made systems following principles developed by *Shayne Flint*.

https://github.com/3worlds/qgraph[qgraph]:: *qgraph* is a _Query system for Graphs_. It implements a Query system that can check all sorts
of conditions applying to objects. It has been designed by *Shayne Flint* for navigating graphs, but it can also be used for many other object types.

https://github.com/3worlds/ymuit[ymuit]:: *ymuit* stands for _Yet More User Interface tools_. It groups tools used to implement the user interface of 3Worlds, mainly color palettes and management of graphic output, which can be useful for any  https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/OpenJFX[javafx]-based interface.

https://github.com/3worlds/tw-core[tw-core]:: *tw-core* is the core of the 3Worlds software. It contains the base classes to design ecosystems and the simulator.

https://github.com/3worlds/tw-apps[tw-apps]:: *tw-apps* contains the two applications needed to run 3Worlds, the _ModelMaker_ and the _ModelRunner_.

https://github.com/3worlds/tw-uifx[tw-uifx]:: *tw-uifx* contains the  https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/OpenJFX[javafx]-based interface classes for _ModelMaker_ and _ModelRunner_.

https://github.com/3worlds/tw-models[tw-models]:: *tw-models* is a library of models designed with 3Worlds, including test and tutorial models.

https://github.com/3worlds/tw-setup[tw-setup]:: *tw-setup* is used solely to create a jar containing all dependencies used by _ModelMaker_ or _ModelRunner_. As such it is not strictly part of 3Worlds.

Libraries **omhtk**, **omugi**, **uit**, **rvgrid**, **aot**, **qgraph**, and **ymuit** are of general interest and can be further developed in order to apply them to other problems. The other libraries (prefixed with **tw-**) are more specific to 3worlds. Currently, we do not provide a javadoc for the latter as it would be useful only to 3worlds developers.

== How to contribute

If you are interested in contributing to 3Worlds or to one of the above libraries, please leave a message to the developers.

== Disclaimer

3Worlds is the result of many years of research and is continuously being improved. Despite our careful testing, problems may subsist. We do our best to fix them, but cannot guarantee that the code is entirely safe. It is certainly adapted to scientific research, but certainly not to any asset- or life-threatening application.
